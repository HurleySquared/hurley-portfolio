## Description of Portfolio Project
Starting with a blank text editor I built the HTML close to where I wanted it.  Next up was building the CSS and adjusting both as I went. The navigation links in the header will take you down below where the main body of my portfolio lies. A short intro to my self comes up first. Following that will be my projects section. Projects includes cards with a image, description, and links to repo and active site. Even further south on the page will bring you to a Contact Me section.  These are all links to profiles and my e-mail.
