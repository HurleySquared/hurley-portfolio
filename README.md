## Description of Portfolio Project
Starting with a blank text editor I built the HTML close to where I wanted it.  Next up was building the CSS and adjusting both as I went. The navigation links in the header will take you down below where the main body of my portfolio lies. A short intro to my self comes up first. Following that will be my projects section. Projects includes an image of my last project Horiseon SEO Refractor that was a clickable link.  The next two beside that are reserved for future projects I will be doing. Even further south on the page will bring you to a contact me section.  These are all links to profiles or my e-mail.
